    <td>Like last week, I learnt through note-taking and listening to the teacher. This week I found that asking questions is a way of clarifying my learning and helping me learn.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to ask more questions. I often find myself in a position where I am unable to continue with my learning and am struggling to move forward. Asking the teacher is a way to get individual help and much more relevant help to you personally.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure I ask a lot of questions to ensure I am making the appropriate improvements and understand fully the task at hand. This week my website could have been improved if I'd of asked more questions. </td>
