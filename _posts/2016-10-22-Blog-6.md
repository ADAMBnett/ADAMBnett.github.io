    <td>Next time I will make sure I work diligently throughout the lesson, making sure I avoid any distractions and try to block them out. I will also make  sure that I rely on myself for help rather than instantly going to the teacher for help. I need to start relying on myself for help as during any tests or exams I will not have a teacher next to me giving help and advice.</td>
