    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned how to create my github page by listening in class and taking notes on my ipad. I took my notes in a folder labeled IT so i knew where it was for future dates.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>People talking in class and me spinning on my chair limited my learning because both of them distracted me. A habit that i need to work on is learning for myself and not relying on the teacher to do all the work for me, and not giving other people the answers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will not get distracted by other people, i shall not ask so many questions that i knew the answer to and i shall not give other people the answers.</td>
