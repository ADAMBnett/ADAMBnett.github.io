    <td>I learnt through note-taking and listening to the teacher. At the front Mr Keen shows us a plan of the lesson and tells us features about GitHub. It's a lot to take in so taking notes is a good way of making sure everything he says is remembered and used when necessary</td>

    <td>Next time I will make sure I pay my full attention to the teaher and not let my mind wonder and instead make sure it is full concentrating on listening to the teacher and taking all the correct information in. I also need to avoid distractions and being distracting.</td>
