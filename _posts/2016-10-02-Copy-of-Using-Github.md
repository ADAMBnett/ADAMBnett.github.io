    <td>I learnt how to use websites like GitHub and how to download Gabriel onto my software. I also realised the importance of note-taking. Listening to the teacher will help me learn and is the most effective strategy ever. This I need to work on in order for my progress to continue. I need to make sure what I hear I put into practise effectively in order to ensure my learning</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on note taking as I was often asking for a repeat of instructions. I also need to improve the quality of my notes as some of them were unclear. They also were not as reliable as I would have hoped, there were many cases where my notes were incorrect. I also am distracting to other people which not only will hinder my own progress but other people's progress also. This is unfair for them and I will try to make sure this habit does not continue</td>

    <td>Next time I will make sure my notes are up to a high standard of work and I will make a considerable effort to ensure I focus and pay attention to what the teacher is saying. I also am very distracted and distracting to myself and others, if I could get rid of this habit net lesson it will my improve my work ethic and quality of work drastically. This habit is mainly sourced from the position I sit in during IT, perhaps if I moved somewhere else where I could block out the distraction it would improve my learning and help others get on with their work.</td>
