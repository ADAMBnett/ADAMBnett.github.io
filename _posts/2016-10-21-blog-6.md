    <td>this lesson I learned by listening to the teacher and copying what things he was doing. I also learned by googling the things that I wanted to learn as I couldn't work out how to get data from the first sheet onto the second, after asking and then searching up what it was I wanted I was able to complete the task having most of my data on different titles pages, I also added an employ√©s section to my work allowing for the sheet to compute wages and subtract that from the budget</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on my asking of questions as I tend to ask questions whenever I am stuck on something and I seemed to ask to many questions. I also took the lesson slightly wrongly, trying to make it accurate to real world wages as opposed to trying to make a good working google sheet </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I would listen to the teacher and work on what is set instead of spending most of the lesson working out real world values, I would instead work on what we are trying to achieve instead of going off on a tangent.</td>
